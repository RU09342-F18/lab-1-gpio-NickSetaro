This project uses the processors to blink two LED's at different rates. The watchdog timer was first disabled to allow the code to run fully. The direction of each LED pin was then set to an output. Before the infinite while loop one LED was set to on and one was set to off to make them alternate. In the while loop i and j are established as counters to keep track of each blink. Once each counter has hit a certain value it will toggle the corresponding LED. The time when each LED blinks can be set by changing the value that it the counters must hit to toggle the light.
