This project uses the MSP430G2553 to blink an LED that is set up on a bread board. The chip in the processor was taken out and placed on the breadboard. The circuit was created by connecting the 3 Volt power supply to pin one. The ground was then connected to pin 20 and also conneccted to the LED in series with the a 220 Ohm resistor and connected to pin 2. Another LED was then connected to pin 14 in series with another 220 ohm resistor. The test and reset were then connected to pins 17 and 16 respectively. The code sets pin 1.0 as output and pin 2.0 through 2.7 as inputs. It then toggles the LEDs by setting pin 1.0 high then delaying and setting it low again.
