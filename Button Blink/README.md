This program uses the microcontrollers to turn an LED on when a button is pressed. The watchdog timer was first disabled to allow the code to run. The button pins direction was then set to input and the LEDs was set to output. The LED was set off to start. In an infinite while loop an integer was used to check if the button was pressed. If the button is pressed then the LED will be set on but if the button is not pressed the LED will be set off.
