This project uses the MSP430G2553 and MSP430F5529LP microcontrollers to blink an LED at a constant rate. The same logic was used on both boards however each has different pin assignments and names. The watchdog timer is disabled first to allow the button to continue blinking. The path is then set to the LED and the direction of the LED pin is set to output. The LED is blinked in an infinite while loop after using a delay to ensure that it does not switch from on to off too quickl to see.
